## Contributing  
Kind advices and contributions are always welcomed, but to avoid chaos or destabilizing in existing work, we have processes that bring people in gradually. In general the process is:  

+ Find a specific bug you'd like to fix or a specific feature youâ€™d like to add (check out the issues list if to get some ideas)  
+ Fix the bug in your own clone and ensure that it's working   
+ Submit the change to the master branch via a pull request
